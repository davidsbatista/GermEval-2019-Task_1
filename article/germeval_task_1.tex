\section{Introduction}

\section{Task}

The GermEval 2010 Shared Task on hierarchical classification of blurbs challenges involved the
classification of books into genres given a book's blurb i.e., a short textual description of the
book.

The competition contained two tasks:

\begin{itemize}

\item Task 1: classify German books into one or multiple most general writing genres. Therfore,
it can be considered a multi-label classification task. In total, there are 8 classes that can be
assigned to a book.

\item Task 2: targets hierarchical multi-label classification into multiple writing genres. In
addition to the very general writing genres, additional genres of different specificity can
be assigned to a book. In total, there are 343 different classes that are hierarchically
structured on up to 4 levels.

\end{itemize}
